# vcluster-rancher-op

First class vCluster support in Rancher

## Description

Deploying a vCluster in rancher should provide the same great experience that provisioning any other cluster in Rancher would. vCluster Rancher Operator automatically integrates vCluster deployments with Rancher. This integration combines the great cluster management of Rancher with the security, cost-effectiveness, and speed of vClusters.

**Features**
* Automatically creates a Rancher Cluster that corresponds to each virtual cluster
* Rancher users do not need cluster management permissions. The operator will create the Rancher cluster.
* Project owners and project members of the vCluster's project will be added to the Rancher cluster as cluster owners.

## Installation

To install, add the loft charts repository to Rancher, and then install this vCluster Rancher Operator chart in the local cluster.
1. Select the local cluster in the Rancher clusters overview page.
2. In the sidebar, navigate to "Apps" -> "Repositories".
3. Select "Create".
4. Set the name to any value and the Index URL to `https://loft.sh/charts`.
5. In the sidebar, navigate to "Apps" -> "Charts".
6. Find and select the "vCluster Rancher Operator" chart.
7. Follow the installation process and install the chart.
8. In the sidebar, navigate to "Workloads" -> "Deployments". Confirm that the deployment named "vcluster-rancher-op" has the State "Active".

Once the operator is installed:
* All vClusters deployed in any downstream cluster will cause a corresponding Rancher cluster to be created
* The vCluster will connect to the corresponding Rancher cluster
* Any project-member or above will be added as a cluster-owner

## Uninstall

1. Select the local cluster in the Rancher clusters overview page.
2. In the sidebar, navigate to "Apps" -> "Installed Apps".
3. Delete the vcluster-rancher-op app

Note that Rancher clusters will not be affected by removing this operator.

## Technical Details


*Downstream Client*

The vCluster Rancher operator runs in Rancher's local cluster and watches clusters.management.cattle.io. 
When a cluster has not been seen by the handler before, it creates a client using the Rancher reverse proxy to talk to the downstream cluster. This is done by creating a token, if needed, for the user.management.cattle.io resource
that is created during the Helm chart install. The token is then used to authenticate requests to the Rancher proxy.

*Rancher Cluster Creation*

Once a client is created for each downstream cluster, it is used to watch all services with the label `app=vcluster`. If a virtual cluster install is found which does not have a corresponding Rancher cluster, the installation process begins. 
The installation process creates a provisioning cluster, waits for Rancher to create the `clusterregistrationtoken.cattle.io`,
and then extracts the command from the `clusterregistrationtoken` status. This command contains everything that is needed to deploy Rancher's cluster agent to the vCluster.
A job is then deployed in the vCluster's host cluster that creates a kubeconfig pointing to the vCluster service in the host cluster. The earlier extracted command is executed using the newly created kubeconfig.

Deletion events for the vCluster service will trigger the controller to delete the corresponding Rancher cluster.

*Project Management*

The service event handler then figures out which project the vCluster is installed in. All Rancher users that have a `projectroletemplatebidning.cattle.io` for the project with either the `project-owner` or `project-member` roles are added as cluster owners, using a `clusterroletemplatebinding.management.cattle.io`, to the virtual cluster's Rancher cluster.

## Development

### General Prerequisites
- docker
- devespace
- rancher installed
- access to local cluster in rancher

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Deploy the manager using devspace**

Note: This is the recommended way to develop on vcluster-rancher-op

```shell
devspace dev
```
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/vcluster-rancher-op:tag
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster using Helm**

```sh
KUBECONFIG=/home/ricardo/dev/rancher-integration/temp-kc.yaml helm install chart --generate-name --create-namespace
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with a custom image**

```sh
KUBECONFIG=/home/ricardo/dev/rancher-integration/temp-kc.yaml helm install chart --generate-name --create-namespace --set image.registry=<REGISTRY> --set image.repository=<REPO/REPO> --set tag=<TAG>
```

### Update RBAC for installed service account
1. Update controller-gen tags in the file `controller/cluster-controller.go`.
2. Run:
```sh
make manifests
```

### To Uninstall
**Delete devspace install:**
```sh
devspace purge
rm -rf .devspace/*
```

**Delete helm install:**

```sh
helm delete <release-name>
```
